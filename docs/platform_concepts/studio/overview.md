## Overview of Agentic architecture

The Agentic architecture in Yellow.ai’s Automation module orchestrates conversations by combining AI-driven intelligence, rule-based logic, and workflows.

* **[AI-driven agents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/get_started/createfirstbot)** – Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), these agents understand context, handle complex or multi-turn conversations, and generate natural, human-like responses. Ideal for open-ended queries and tasks that require reasoning or dynamic information retrieval.
* **[Rule-based agents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/create_chatbot)**(Deterministic agents) – These agents operate using structured logic and predefined nodes, progressing through deterministic workflows. Best suited for repetitive tasks such as booking forms, order tracking, or surveys.
* **[Workflows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/call-workflow)** – Workflows act as the backend processes that agents invoke to perform actions like API calls, database updates, sending notifications, or triggering automated tasks. Both AI-driven and rule-based agents depend on workflows to complete tasks and maintain seamless conversation flow.

### Camprision between AI-driven agents and Rule-based agents

Aspect | AI-driven agent | Rule-based Agent
-------|-----------|------------------
**Mechanism** |	Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret context and make dynamic decisions. | Uses structured logic and predefined rules to guide conversations.
**Conversation handling** | Handles complex, multi-turn, and open-ended conversations. | Handles linear, step-by-step conversations suited for predictable scenarios.
**Context awareness** | Retains and uses context from previous interactions to provide personalized responses. | Relies on predefined conditions and user inputs to guide conversations.
**Flexibility**	| Adapts to varied user inputs and handle unexpected queries. | Follows rigid flows and handle only predefined scenarios.
**Use case** | Best for customer support with complex queries, troubleshooting, dynamic FAQs, and personalized recommendations. | Best for booking processes, order tracking, surveys, feedback collection, and other structured requests. |

## AI agent components

### Super agent

[Super agent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/agentpersona) acts as the central orchestrator of all conversations within the AI agent. It intelligently routes user queries to the appropriate agent whether an AI-driven agent for complex, context-rich conversations or a rule-based agent for structured, deterministic workflows based on the query, conversation context, and predefined criteria.

### Agent

Individual [agents ](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/agent) help to focus on specific conversation tasks, such as booking tickets, handling cancellations, or answering product-related queries.

The Super Agent coordinates these interactions by analyzing the user’s intent and routing the query to the most relevant agent. For example, if a user asks about refund eligibility, the Super Agent will trigger the Refund Agent, while a booking query would be directed to the Booking Agent.

### Knowledge Base (KB) Agent

The [Knowledge Base agent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/kb-agent-config) is a specialized AI-driven component designed to handle knowledge-intensive queries. It retrieves, summarizes, and delivers answers from knowledge sources like documents, FAQs, or external systems. It also supports follow-up questions, multilingual responses, and context-aware answers.

### Rule-based agents

Rule-based agents, also known as node-based flows, are a key component of the agentic architecture. Unlike AI agents that rely on LLMs for contextual reasoning, rule-based agents operate through predefined paths and mapped intents. They are best suited for scenarios where interactions must follow a structured, predictable sequence such as authentication, form-filling, or survey collection.

In this setup, the **Super agent** determines when a conversation should follow a rule-based flow and routes the user to the appropriate agent. The rule-based agent then executes the step-by-step conversation paths to guide the users.

#### **Nodes in rule-based Agents**

In rule-based agents, [nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes) act as the fundamental building blocks of the conversation. Each node represents a specific action such as asking a question, validating input, branching logic, or triggering backend processes. By linking nodes together, these agents create structured paths that guide users to the desired outcome.

**Nodes are useful for:**

* **Collecting information**: Capture user inputs like name, email, phone number, preferences, or booking details. **Example**: Asking the user for their flight date or delivery address.
* **Conditional branching**: Direct the conversation along different paths based on user inputs. **Example**: If a user selects "Yes" → proceed to payment, if "No" → proceed to next step.
* **Fetching data**: Retrieve information from databases, APIs, or external systems. Example: Fetching flight availability, order status, or user account details.
* **Data pushing / Backend integration**: Send collected information to external systems or databases for processing.
**Example**: Storing booking details in a Database.
* **Mathematical and Logical Operations**: Perform calculations or validations during the conversation using [Functions](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/code). **Example**: Calculating total cost, validating an age or date, or checking inventory.
* **Dynamic rich media generation**: Create interactive and engaging responses using carousels, images, and quick replies. **Example**: Displaying flight options in a carousel or showing payment instructions with buttons.
* **Triggering Workflows or APIs**: Initiate automated workflows or external API calls from within the conversation.

### Workflows in AI-powered Agents and Rule-based Flows

Workflows are specialized automation that agents call during a conversation to perform backend tasks, such as making API calls, updating database, or sending notifications. Both AI-powered agents and rule-based flows can use workflows, but they trigger them differently:

* **AI-powered agents** – Use the [Call Workflow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/call-workflow#call-a-workflow-in-prompt) action within the prompts to trigger a workflow. This allows the agent to dynamically process user input, fetch data, or complete actions before continuing the conversation.
* **Rule-based agents** – Use the [Execute node ](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/execute-flow)to call a [workflow](http://localhost:3000/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys#create-a-workflow-via-workflow-builder-section) from a predefined step in the conversational flow.

<!-- 1. **Workflows in AI-powered Agents**

    AI-powered agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand intent and manage open-ended, context-driven conversations. Workflows are triggered dynamically, based on what the user says and what the conversation requires.

   **How they work:**

   * The agent drives the conversation using configured prompts, asking questions and interpreting responses.
   * When a backend action is needed (example, verifying identity, updating a database, fetching real-time data), the agent dynamically decides which workflow to call.

   **Example: Ticket cancellation scenario**

    **User**: "I want to cancel my flight ticket for tomorrow."
    *  The AI agent interprets the intent ("ticket cancellation") and asks clarifying questions, example, "Can you provide your booking ID?""
    * Once the required details are collected, the AI agent dynamically triggers the ticket cancellation workflow in the backend, which handles:
       * Verifying the booking ID
       * Checking cancellation policies
       * Processing the refund or confirmation
    * After the workflow completes, the AI agent provides a contextual response, example, "Your ticket has been successfully cancelled, and a refund of "$X" will be processed within 5 business days".

2. **Workflows in Rule-based flows**

    Rule-based flows use workflows at predefined points in the conversation. The conversational flow initiates when and how a workflow should be triggered, regardless of the specific user or their individual needs.

    **How they work:**
     
     * Rule-based flows follow predefined conditions, logic, and steps. 
     * Workflows are embedded at specific points to perform defined actions.

    **Example: Sending an OTP verification**

      The rule-based flow is configured as:
           * Collect user details (e.g., phone number).
           * Trigger the OTP workflow to send the code.
           * Wait for user input and validate the OTP.
           * The OTP workflow is executed exactly at the defined step. -->
