Call agent action triggers another agent within an agent, pausing the current agent and switching control to the specified target agent.

**Sample scenario: Flight booking use case**

#### Scenario

Suppose a user interacts with Yellow Travels AI agent to book a flight. After booking, they immediately want to cancel the same ticket.

Hereâ€™s how the Call Agent action helps:

1. The user starts by interacting with the **main agent** (Yellow Travels AI agent).
2. For booking a ticket, the main agent calls the **Flight   Booking agent**, which handles:
   * Collecting travel details
   * Checking availability
   * Confirming the booking
3. If the user later requests a cancellation, the main agent uses **Call agent** to switch to the **Cancellation agent**, which validates booking details and processes the cancellation.
